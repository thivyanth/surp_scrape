This will be done in a gravity-driven filter-column set-up, which would run without any power, ideal in a resource-constrained scenario.

The optimum hybrid material in terms of NP size and surface number density of these particles, on different patterned carbon surfaces would be found, to be used for the gravity-driven POU system.

Koita Centre for Digital Health (KCDH),Developing statistical models for predicting celltype-specific effect of non-coding mutations,Professor: Saket Choudhary,UID: DH02,"Mutations in non-coding DNA sequences are frequently associated with diseases. A current challenge in the field is to predict the effect of a non-coding mutation on gene expression given the cryptic and 
highly redundant nature of the non-coding regulatory sequences. While population genetic studies have been successful in identifying genomic loci associated with disease, they have limited interpretability for two primary reasons. First, these methods struggle at distinguishing between disease-causal and disease-associated genetic variants because of linkage disequilibrium. Second, these methods are limited in terms of their statistical power to discover associations involving rare variants.

Recent advances in deep learning have enabled integrating information from long-range interactions (up to 100kb away) in the genome to predict gene expression from DNA sequences alone. These 
methods have enabled a novel way to distill large amounts of genomic and phenotypic information into a single model. The high accuracy of these models at predicting gene expression from DNA sequence alone indicates that they are able to recognize features of the DNA sequence which are highly predictive of the phenotype (gene expression).

The current state-of-the-art (Enformer)  models to predict expression from DNA sequence alone were trained using bulk RNA-seq data which limits their ability to predict the expression state in all disease-relevant cell types in the human brain system. This project will extend the current state-of-the-arts sequence-to-expression model to  predict the impact of mutations in the non-coding genome in a celltype-specific manner by incorporating single-cell data spanning multiple species.

Liver histology is currently the reference standard for diagnosing and assessing disease progression, but biopsies are invasive and difficult to perform in steatotic patients because of health risks besides being prone to subjective variation in pathological interpretation. Despite its high prevalence, with every third adult in India suffering from MASLD}, there is a lack of robustly validated biomarkers for prognosis, diagnosis, and continuous monitoring of disease progression or regression.  With the advent of high-throughput genomics, we can characterize gene expression levels and associated regulatory states in individual celltypes across multiple donors.

Mechanical Engineering,Dynamics of Kirigami Metamaterials,Professor: R. Ganesh,UID: ME06,"Metamaterials are a class of artificially designed structures whose properties are a function of the constituent material, as well as the geometry/topology of the structure. For example, an auxetic 2D-Lattice subjected to a uniaxial stretch expands in the orthogonal direction, thereby demonstrating an effective “negative” Poisson’s ratio (in contrast, the constituent material has a positive Poisson’s ratio).  Since the architecture or geometry plays an important role in the unconventional properties, Kirigami, the art of cutting paper to form 3-D shapes starting from 2-D sheets has been found to be quite relevant to the design of mechanical metamaterials. Specifically, application of load to a 2-D sheet architected with small cuts induces out-of-plane buckling of the individual links, and results in the introduction of bending stiffness to the structure (which is negligible in the uncut specimen due to its negligible thickness). An interesting application of these structures is in the field of soft robotics, where shape morphing is employed to elicit locomotion through deformation. However, most studies focus only on rectilinear locomotion. In this project, we will intend to explore the ability to achieve shape morphing and realize various modes of deformation-induced locomotion (such as bending/twisting) through a localized dynamic excitation and making it completely reversible.",1/2,"Students entering their 3rd year, Students entering their 4th/5th year",7.5 and above,A background in Solid Mechanics (ideally a grade of BB or above in ME 201/202/223 or any other department equivalent).

Conventional ironmaking technologies involve reduction of iron ore agglomerates with carbon and CO-rich reductants, leading to a CO2-footprint. Hydrogen is a potent alternate and its use as a reductant is expected the reduce the overall CO emission from ironmaking. However, technologies for using near-100% H2 as a reducing agent are theoretically possible but exist only at lab/pilot scale.
Successful transition from C/CO to H2 as the reductant of choice is dependent on clearly understanding the mechanism(s) of reaction with H2, vis-à-vis CO, and the rate controlling step(s). An earlier work in MEMS Department has shown that reduction of iron oxides involves multiple steps, often having contradicting requirements for enhancing the reaction kinetics. With this background, it is proposed to investigate in detail the mechanism of each step of reduction through controlled experiments and characterization, with an aim to understand the differences caused if CO is replaced with H2 as the reductant.",02,Students entering their 4th/5th year,Minimum 6.5 (7.0 and above preferred),Should have cleared a course on thermodynamics and on transport phenomena.

Multidisciplinary,Anomaly detection via signatures,Professor: Debasish Chatterjee,UID: MD03,"Anomalies occur in distributed networked systems when components break down naturally or change properties over time, or when adversaries inject malicious inputs to damage the system.

The most clever attacks are the hardest to detect: In networked systems such attacks may breach the cyber layer and introduce software in the physical layer that lurk in the system, clone itself and communicate between the clones, learn about the network over a long time, and act only sporadically to damage the system. The Stuxnet attack in the first half of the preceding decade is a case in point. It is crucial to detect such adversarial attacks quickly enough before the system is irrecoverably compromised.

This project is about the development of a technique based on an analytical property of dynamical systems called the signature, to the detection of difficult-to-detect anomalies in networked systems. Our thrust will be to develop new and reliable methods of anomaly detection while being numerically viable.

Systems and Control Engineering (SYSCON),QuITO V.3: Numerical optimal control under path constraints,Professor: Debasish Chatterjee,UID: SYS01,"This project concerns the development of release 3 of the QuITO suite of tools dedicated to the development of numerical methods for solving optimal control problems under paths constraints. The latest version V.2 was released on github recently; an overview of the suite of tools may be found here: https://www.sc.iitb.ac.in/~chatterjee/master/homepage/quito.html.

Students are encouraged to take a look at the accompanying document  https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13681 for an overview of the theoretical underpinnings of the toolset as it stands currently. Version 3 will target subtle refinements of V.2 on the theoretical side by widening the class of problems, including tools from geometric integration, and including distributed parameter systems within its ambit.

QuITO is backed by solid theory set down across several publications; a previous release of QuITO has been patented, and more patent applications are in the process of being filed. Applications on QuITO include all applications involving trajectory generation and planning under constraints, such as path planning in challenging and hazardous environments, satellite re-entry problems, guidance and navigation.

Students are expected to take a deep dive into numerical methods of optimal control with a balanced emphasis on theory and implementation. QuITO encompasses a new and unusual set of tools derived from several areas of engineering and mathematics, and there is tremendous scope for introducing yet newer and nuanced methods in the problems.

Systems and Control Engineering (SYSCON),Anomaly detection via signatures,Professor: Debasish Chatterjee,UID: SYS02,"Anomalies occur in distributed networked systems when components break down naturally or change properties over time, or when adversaries inject malicious inputs to damage the system. We will focus on adversarial attacks.

The most clever attacks are the hardest to detect: In networked systems such attacks may breach the cyber layer and introduce software in the physical layer that lurk in the system, clone itself and communicate between the clones, learn about the network over a long time, and act only sporadically to damage the system. The Stuxnet attack in the first half of the preceding decade is a case in point. It is crucial to detect such adversarial attacks quickly enough before the system is irrecoverably compromised.

This project is about the development of a technique based on an analytical property of dynamical systems called the signature, to the detection of difficult-to-detect anomalies in networked systems. Our thrust will be to develop new and reliable methods of anomaly detection while being numerically viable. Similar techniques for early detection of the onset of neurodegenerative diseases in humans can be developed simultaneously.

Students will be expected to study and master the mathematical technique, design algorithms and develop the corresponding software.",3,"Students entering their 2nd year, Students entering their 3rd year, Students entering their 4th/5th year",8 and above,Curiosity and seriousness.,3 months; extendable to 1-3 years,"Exposure to the very interesting and deep theoretical apparatus of signatures and bringing it to the forefront of anomaly detection; as a consequence, publications in top journals and conferences of ML and cybernetics.",20 hr per week during the summer and weekly meetings (online if necessary),Restricted access; send me an email to discuss.,Material will be provided at the start of the project.,undefined

Explicit MPC in the nonlinear regime via approximation theoretic tools has been settled for low-dimensional systems in https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03027 and for moderate-dimensional systems in our subsequent work (under review) that employed deep neural networks.
