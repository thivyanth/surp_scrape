                                    <td>Cadmium Zinc Telluride detectors are highly sensitive for detecting hard X-ray photons in the energy range from 20-200 keV. A specific type of these detectors has been used in multiple Indian space missions including AstroSat, Aditya-L1, etc. They will also be used for the proposed IITB-led Daksha space mission ( www.dakshasat.in ). 
To optimally use these detectors, we need to study them in detail in the lab and measure their performance under varying temperatures. We need to map the conversion of photon energy to an electronic readout, measure electronic noise, and study noisy pixels at various timescales.
The CZT detector, composed of N-type semiconductor material, serves the crucial role of detecting high-energy photons within the energy spectrum of 20 to 200 KeV. However, its performance is subject to the influence of electronic noise, crystal impurities, and thermal noise inherent to the system. 
The Daksha mission will require us to test about 1500 such detectors in the lab. The goal of this project is to lay the foundation of this monumental effort using the state-of-the-art Thermal Chamber and Clean room facilities available at STAR Lab.</td>

In the pursuit of detecting high-energy events in astrophysical objects, we are actively working on enhancing the data readout process. Presently, our setup involves CZT (Cadmium Zinc Telluride) detectors integrated into an FPGA board capable of accommodating up to 20 detectors, forming what is known as the "ME" (Medium Energy Range 20-200 KeV) box. This system is controlled via LABVIEW.

The primary goal of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the existing FPGA readout schemes for the ME board and, subsequently, to optimize and improve these schemes.</td>

                                    <td>Gamma-ray bursts are explosions in the universe that come from the death of massive stars or the merger of neutron-star black-hole systems. GRBs give out a luminous initial burst called prompt emission and late broad-band emission called afterglow. Afterglows are modeled as a power law function in time and energy, where the index gives us information about the Lorentz factor of electrons in the jet, the density of the interstellar medium, etc. Different space telescopes like AstroSat, Swift, Chandra, Fermi etc observe in different energy ranges: and combining their data gives a complete picture of the broad emission.

                                    <td>Gamma-ray bursts are explosions in the universe that come from the death of massive stars or the merger of neutron-star black-hole systems. GRBs give out a luminous initial burst called prompt emission and late broad-band emission called afterglow. The prompt emission is generated by shock-accelerated electrons in highly collimated relativistic jets. These jets interact with the surrounding medium to give out afterglow. In this project, we will use afterglowpy - the current, easy-to-understand, broadband afterglow fitting python package, to estimate jet parameters like total kinetic energy, angular span of the jet, etc and understand the physics behind these emission mechanisms.

Afterglowpy modeling

Students will collaborate closely with international partners to analyze data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) for the identification of new asteroids, which will be reported to the Minor Planet Centre (MPC). By working with GIT, students will gain hands-on experience in real-time target observation to enhance orbital information and confirm the status of these objects as NEOs, ultimately leading to their publication as Minor Planet Electronic Circulars (MPECs). Students can also conduct follow-up observations of known comets to discover their outbursts, contributing to the publication of Astronomer's Telegrams (ATels). Another aim of this project is to improve the GIT in-house Astreaks pipeline, which is employed for processing non-sidereal data. Students will focus on improving the astrometric calculations within the pipeline, with the goals of reducing processing time and developing a more precise method for photometry of asteroids and comets observed by GIT.

                                    <td>The project aims to develop and improve the image subtraction and source identification (vetting) pipelines for the GROWTH-India Telescope. Students will be responsible for testing and enhancing the image subtraction program to ensure its robustness with more complex data. Regarding vetting, students will work on both analytical and machine learning (ML)--based pipelines for distinguishing between real sources and false positives. This project involves creating datasets for the ML pipeline, injecting real sources, conducting human scans, and comprehensive testing. The pipeline will eventually be integrated into the GIT system, facilitating various transient searches such as identifying novae in the M31 galaxy, discovering Electromagnetic counterparts of Gravitational Waves (EMGW), and detecting Gamma-ray burst afterglows, among others. Good students will have the unique opportunity to work closely with a Caltech professor and other international collaborators for this project, and a chance to co-author refereed publications.</td>
